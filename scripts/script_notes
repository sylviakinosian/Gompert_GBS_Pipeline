#BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.

~/hts_tools/bwa/bwa mem -t 10 -w 50 -k 20 -a -C -R "@RG\tID:$ids\tLB:$ids\tSM:$ids\tPL:ILLUMINA"

-t #number of threads
-w #band width: gaps longers than [50] will not be found; not solely determined here
-k #minimum seed length: matched shorted than [20] will be missed
-a #output all found alignments for single-end or unpaired paired-end reads; flagged as secondary alignments
-C #appened FASTA/Q commont to SAM output
-R #complete read group header line
