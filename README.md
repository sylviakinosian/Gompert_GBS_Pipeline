## Pteridium GBS Pipeline

This repository is a collection of scripts for a pipeline for processing Illumina data and analysis using the population genomics program ENTROPY.

This pipeline was developed by Sylvia Kinosian, Zach Gompert, and Martin Schilling.

Please refer to the Pteridium\_GBS\_Tutorial.html document for pipeline usage. 

The scripts folder contains all the scripts needed for the pipeline, as well as a few additional scripts a user might find helpful. Please look at each script, read the notes and usage before implementing.
