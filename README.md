## Pteridium GBS Pipeline

This repository is a collection of scripts for a GBS pipeline for Illumina data.

This pipeline (in its current version) was developed by Zach Gompert, Martin Schilling, and Sylvia Kinosian

The scripts folder contains all the scripts needed for the pipeline, as well as a few additional scripts a user might find helpful. Please look at each script, read the notes and usage before implementing.

Please refer to the Pteridium_GBS_Tutorial.html document for pipeline usage. Any questions can be directed to: sylvia.kinosian@gmail.com.
