This repository is a collection of scripts for a GBS pipeline for Illumina data.

This pipeline (in its current version) was developed by Zach Gompert and Martin Schilling.

The scripts folder contains all the scipts needed for the pipeline, as well as a few additional scripts a user might find useful. Please look at each script, read the notes and useage before implementing.

Please refer to the pipeline_cheat_sheet document for how to use. **This is a rough outline**
